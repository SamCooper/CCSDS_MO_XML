                 comment="The session control service provides two main ares of funcionality. The first is the ability to request control of a service provider and the second area is the process alive reporting.&#xA;For the requesting of control, a client invokes the setControlMode operation with a TRUE Boolean argument to request control of the service provider. Once control has been granted only operations from that consumer will be allowed until the controlling consumer releases control using the setControlModel operation again but this time with a FALSE Boolean argument.&#xA;For the alive reporting the service defines a single COM event that service providers should generate at a predefined interval. If a service provider crashes then the absense of this event will indicate a problem.">
